## My Ethical Principles

_Think of this like your data science ten commandments with respect to ethically using data and data science tools._

Ive never really thought about the ethics of data before this class. One of my first guiding principles for my ethics, is I want to work for a company that  produces good for the world. I dont want to make it too specific because I need to take it company by company. That is why I feel comfortable working at USAA, helping veterans with their financial needs is a cause I can believe in, or for the most part that is why a data job in healthcare is appealing.If the data is deidentified, I personally dont have an issue with data being shared to improve models or to be used on research. I do have issues when companies sell personal information to other companies. Up until this class, I always had a goal to work for a FAANG company now not so much. When companies become extremely large, I believe it is almost impossible to be ethical. I now care more about the mission of the company and the work they do than the company I put on my linkedin and the check I get.

The Future of Data Engineering:

For example, as companies demand more real time data and companies work with larger and larger data that will put more o a stress on the data 

Data Science Job Seeking Advice:

- You will learn the hardskills in school, but most interviews will focus on soft skills. When interviewing for internships or first jobs the companies are well aware that you dont know much. They want to see how you think.
