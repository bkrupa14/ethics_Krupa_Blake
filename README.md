## My Ethical Principles

_Think of this like your data science ten commandments with respect to ethically using data and data science tools._

Ive never really thought about the ethics of data before this class. One of my first guiding principles for my ethics, is I want to work for a company that  produces good for the world. I dont want to make it too specific because I need to take it company by company. That is why I feel comfortable working at USAA, helping veterans with their financial needs is a cause I can believe in, or for the most part that is why a data job in healthcare is appealing.If the data is deidentified, I personally dont have an issue with data being shared to improve models or to be used on research. I do have issues when companies sell personal information to other companies. Up until this class, I always had a goal to work for a FAANG company now not so much. When companies become extremely large, I believe it is almost impossible to be ethical. I now care more about the mission of the company and the work they do than the company I put on my linkedin and the check I get from them. 

Guiding Principles:

- Dont sell identifiable data without permission
- Dont work for a company that forces people how to think(through ML algorithms)
- Work for a company that beleives in doing good(yes this is personal)
- Reevulate the good your work is doing and try to find any negative consequences
- Be aware of your own bias that you bring into your data job
- Be aware that the numbers and columns are real people
- Be willing to leave when your ethical lines begins to be crossed

## Reading Discussion

Scientists Are Just as Confused About the Ethics of Big-Data Research as You:

- It was interesting to see that for a large part there isnt a giant governing body who says what is allowed and what isnt allowed when it comes to gathering and using data for research. It was interesting to learn that this is done usually by the university or research instution itself. This makes me a little nervous because personally most universities, dont have a strong understanding of Data governance practices and how and why data needs to be stored a certain way.
      
Web Scraping Myth:

- This might make me a bad person, but I personally dont have an issue with webscrapping. When I have done it in the past, it has never involved PII so that might be why I dont feel like it is a big deal. I also feel like the first line of defense needs to come from the user and be aware of what they choose to post online. It is interesting Ive worked with a few companies who have helped them webscrape and a difficult concept for them to grasp was just because they have this data, there still needs to be more to be able to make business decisions with it.

Starting a Data Science Start up:

Data Science is still very much a buzz word. This has its positives and its negatives. Since it is so popular, there are currently a ton of jobs with data science in the title and if that is your passion there will be no shortage of companies to work for. The negatives are that the word is not uniform and most people know the word but not the definition. Some want to hire a data scientist to simply build dashboard all day in a non-coding environment. Other have heard the term neural network and wants a scientist to build neural networks all day even though it doesnt fit the business problem. Data science is simply gathering data to find insights. This can be through model building or dashboard, but most often both.

How Big Data is unfair:

By following the data alone, we may put things or people into groups that do not always fit the bill. This can be problematic when we are dealinbg with an individuals life and significantly less when amazon recommends a blue sweater instead of a red sweater. Most importantly it is important for people to understand the defincies of ML models. As more of these types of algorithms become integrated into our lives such with policing and healthcare it will be even more important for these "non data people" to understand the data that is assisiting in this decision making process.

Facebook Files:

- Facebook knows all. It is important that you are aware of the good and the bad of the companies you choose to work for. Facebook seems to be motivated by money and not so much by ethics. They dont seem pushed to change unless there is a law or fee being pushed upon them.

Ethics of Driverless Cars:

- Part of the issue with driverless cars, is that americans love to sue people and so when something goes wrong they need someone to sue. I find it difficult to believe that fully driverless cars will ever be possible during my lifetime simply for that reason. Companies are unwilling to take on that much risk. We as a society feel safer when the brain of a human instead of the logic of a computer is involved. 

The Future of Data Engineering:

- What I learned was that as data needs become more complicated and businesses push the envelope on what they want to accomplish the need for data centered careers will grow. For example, as companies demand more real time data and companies work with larger and larger data that will put more o a stress on the data 

Data Science Job Seeking Advice:

- You will learn the hardskills in school, but most interviews will focus on soft skills. When interviewing for internships or first jobs the companies are well aware that you dont know much. They want to see how you think.

What happens when we let the Government store our information:

- Personally this makes me the most nervous. I am not a big fan of large government oversight to begin with. Having a large entity that is able to have access to a ton of personal information about every citizen and that large entity changes game plan almost every 4-8 years makes me very uncomfortable. To me data stored with a single entity seems to make me uneasy because it can also make it alot easier to steal. Stealing government secrets is one thing but stealing info on every american seems much worse to me.

Physiognomy's New Clothes

- Those who wish to go into the research space, I believe this is a very important article to be aware of. On the surface creating an algorithm that can detect criminals with 90% accuracy with just an ID seems fantastic, but at what cost? Having these types of models and the desire to solve these type of problems is a great thing and something we should embrace but we shouldnt be so niave to take it at face value. How many of faces did the model predict to be a criminal when they actually werent? These are the questions we need to focus on more, the false positives when it comes to more ethical models.Using only the model is bad practice, but in order to improve we need to see our weaknesses so we can find solutions to correct them. People need to understand that Machine Learning isnt magic, we still need the logic and empatht that only a human can provide.






## Final Grade



I think for my final grade I deserve an A. During the start of the semester I was gone alot due to having covid and the health issues that made it difficult to attend reguarly.  Once I recovered I came almost every class period and even while I was sick I made sure to be in touch with my team and to work on my part of prepping the data. I was also able to hit well over the goal of 107 hours for the semetser. My contributions to our project was prepping around 700 lines of data  and creating the target variable. I also built an LSTM model to predict Lattitude and logitude. On wednesdays during class discussions I felt like I often participated in the discussion by voicing my opinion and sharing interesting insights. For our deliverable, we are presening the best working model to LyteWorx and will be explaining how it works.
